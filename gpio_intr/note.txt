Figuring out the exact GPIO was not totally obvious when there were multiple GPIOs in the system. One way to do is to go into
the gpiochips in /sys/class/gpio and view the label as it should reflect the address of the GPIO in the system. The name of the
the chip appears to be the 1st GPIO of the controller.

zynq> cat /sys/class/gpio/gpiochip0/label 
xgpiops
zynq> cat /sys/class/gpio/gpiochip255/label 
/amba@0/gpio@41200000
